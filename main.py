# we first create a basic example to illustrate the optical bloch equations

# we start with the simple case of a two-level system
# we first define some values needed

# import to use complex numbers
import cmath

# we first define the 2 transition frequencies
w12 = 1 * 10**5  # Hz transition between levels 1 and 2
w23 = 1   # transition between levels 2 and 3
